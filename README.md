# Intermediate Python Course

Hey there, 

In this course you will create a dice-rolling program using python. The code you create will be stored in the dice-roller.py file. This repo also contains course materials under the issues tab. 

Here are some potential Next Steps for you:
1. Add more inputs(like player or team name).
2. Store each player's roll totals in separate arrays.
3. Choose a dice-based game that you can fully simulate using python.
